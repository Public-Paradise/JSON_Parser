This program is hard coded with a URL that randomly generates credencials for JSON files.
Once the URL has been added, the javax.json.stream.JsonParser class then parses the file.
Key events are recognized through the parsers built in method.
Once specified which Events to look for, the parser then prints out the Key_Names to console.
